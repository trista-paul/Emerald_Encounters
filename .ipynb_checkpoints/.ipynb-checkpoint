    "This database is to provide a tool for a particular challenge run in the videogame \"Pokemon Emerald\" where the ROM has been altered to disable experience gain. In this run, caught Pokemon will be stuck with the moves they are first caught with. This database has tables for all in-game locations and includes the available Pokemon at that location, their maximum possible level at encounter, and their four move slots in respect to their level. \n",
